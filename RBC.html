<h1> RBC Academy Application - Frederick Westthorp </h1>

	<tr>
		<td> <b> 1. How does RBC differentiate itself from its competitors and why does it appeal to you? </b> </td>
	<tr>
		<td> From a computing standpoint, RBC have acknowledged a talent gap in the Cyber Security field that many other banks have largely ignored. Across my research of the RBC bank, I found the many educational initiatives, to help the public understand the terms and concepts you use in practice, very unique and insightful. I specifically found the 'Cyber Security Terms Explained' article interesting, as I have created a similar video of my own for my Graphic Design Coursework.

<p> </p>
The use of the 'Kidsplanation' idea to explain fundamentals made complicated concepts seem simplified and I can see how this can encourage your clients to make themselves, and therefore your own systems, more cyber secure. </td>
	<tr>
		<td> <b> 2. What attracts you to a role in Technology with RBC? What activities would you expect to carry out on a day to day basis? </b> </td>
	<tr>
		<td> I understand that many applicants can boast about 'punctuality' and a 'determination to work and study', however I also feel that my motivated, outgoing and, it may seem silly but, considerate character makes me particularly appropriate for the role on a day-to-day basis.

After studying English Literature for the first year of A-Level, I am able to comfortably complete admin tasks within a workplace and my submission of a 60,000 word and a 30,000 word Computer Science coursework across my A-Level and undergraduate studies shows that I can demonstrate commitment to assignments. I expect RBC to assign me both administrative and practical tasks which I feel, for both cases, I can complete confidently.

I can competently program in an object-orientated language (Java), a functional programming language (Haskell) and a close to the system language (C). Also confident with web development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and accustom to navigating UNIX systems. I have also used these HTML foundations to make practice web pages incorporating CSS and JavaScript - such as this webpage. The source code for this page can be viewed below:

		<td> <b> 3. What has been your greatest non-academic achievement/accomplishment within the last 2 years? (150 words) </b> </td>
	<tr> 
		<td> The leading and planning of a hiking trip to the lake district, to gain my Mark Evison Foundation Award, was an achievement that I would consider my proudest. The Mark Evison Foundation came to me and I signed up to the initiative with a group of my school peers. Between us we then researched possible routes for a hiking journey and finally decided, in the following January, that an expedition to the Lake District would be within our physical and financial capabilities. The foundation gave us a £500 fund for the trip, which I was then able to use to purchase the relevant meals and equipment for our group in correspondence with our pre-planned budgeting. The team then put me in charge of navigating us across the country to our Hiking spot in Keswick and ensuring the planning and execution of the trip ran smoothly. I contacted the relevant train, coach and taxi companies to organise our transportation to and from our hiking destination. This experience gave me a great sense of responsibility as I needed to ensure that the trip ran smoothly from start to finish not only for myself, but also for my team. This journey separated us from the busy London lifestyle that we had grown so accustomed to and allowed me personally to experience a level of dependability and independence that I will apply to future challenges.
