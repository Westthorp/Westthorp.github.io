  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    About Me: Currently an undergraudate at the University of Warwick where I am using my studies to explore all areas of computer science in the hope to narrow down a prospective profession. I built my passion for computing by first developing an intrest in the cyber sector and specifically cyber security. My GCSE Graphic Communcations coursework allowed me to produce a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY2N4gza91E">cyber awareness campaign</a> that addressed internet privacy. The success of my informative video showed me that I wanted to delve into cyber work - leading me to my choice of degree. However, while studying my University Modules I was exposed to programming, the design and sustaining of Information Structures, Computer Architecture and the inner workings of computer systems and the legal and ethical considerations surrounding computing. Although challenging, my studies so far have posed as an insight into what is truely avaliable to me within computing and made me comfortable with applying myself to unpredictable challenges.
